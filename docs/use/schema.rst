JSON Schema
===========

A ``urljsf`` form definition should conform to the overall JSON schema, and may
include additional, nested schema and documents, represented inline or referenced
by URL.

The `Draft 7` schema is used due to its wide implementation but, most specifically,
it is the latest draft natively supported in `rjsf`.
